# NaNoGenMo-2016: Superphreak
The repository for the NaNoGenMo 2016 novel "Superphreak," a travel/adventure/personal journal from the perspective of an 80's phone hacker ("phreak") going on various "trashing" runs to phone switches/substations in Monmouth County, New Jersey. I'm going to be making a lot of mistakes, so it's going to get messy over here.
