# NaNoGenMo-2016: Superphreak
 The repository for the NaNoGenMo 2016 novel "Superphreak," a travel/adventure/personal journal from the perspective of an 80's phone hacker ("phreak") going on various "trashing" runs to phone switches/substations in Monmouth County, New Jersey. I'm going to be making a lot of mistakes, so it's going to get messy over here. 

# End-of-month Update

Well, I'm a day (or so) late, but wanted to update the repo with what I'm considering a first draft. This project still has a lot of interesting avenues to pursue, but I'm one computed novel down with (hopefully) many more to go.
